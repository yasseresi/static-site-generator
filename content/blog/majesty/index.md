# His Majesty: The Return of the King

The return of Aragorn as King Elessar marks one of the most triumphant moments in *The Lord of the Rings*. His journey from Ranger to King embodies the themes of destiny, sacrifice, and renewal that run throughout Tolkien's work.

## The Rightful Heir

Aragorn is the **heir of Isildur**, the rightful king of Gondor and Arnor. His lineage traces back through the Dúnedain Rangers to the ancient kings of the North.

### The Ranger Years

Before claiming his throne, Aragorn spent decades as:

- A **Ranger of the North**
- Protector of the Shire and Eriador
- *Strider* - a mysterious figure known to few
- Guardian of ancient bloodlines and forgotten kingdoms

## The Path to Kingship

Aragorn's journey to the throne involved several crucial moments:

1. **Accepting his heritage** at the Council of Elrond
2. Leading the Fellowship after Gandalf's fall
3. Taking the Paths of the Dead
4. **Healing the sick** in the Houses of Healing
5. Being crowned King Elessar

### The Healing Hands

One of the signs of the true king was the ability to heal:

> "The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known."

Aragorn's healing of Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry in the Houses of Healing proved his royal blood and gave hope to the people of Gondor.

## The Reunited Kingdom

Under King Elessar's rule:

- **Gondor and Arnor** were reunited after centuries
- Peace was established with former enemies
- The age of Men truly began
- Trade and prosperity flourished

## Quotes About the King

> "Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!"

### His Character

What makes Aragorn a great king isn't just his bloodline, but his character:

- **Wisdom** gained through years of hardship
- Compassion for all peoples
- *Humility* despite his royal heritage  
- Understanding of sacrifice and duty

## The Fourth Age

As King Elessar, Aragorn:

1. Ruled for 120 years
2. **Restored the glory** of the ancient kingdoms
3. Maintained peace throughout his reign
4. Prepared Middle-earth for the Age of Men

His reign marked the end of the Elder Days and the beginning of the dominion of Men, fulfilling the long arc of Tolkien's historical vision.

The king had returned, and with him came hope, healing, and a new age of peace.
